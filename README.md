# python-worm2.1_Xploit
Im making this because I'm interested in increasing my knowledge about computer works, they are an entire new way of cyber guerilla warfare, and using these with Leviathan, I can easily infect 1000:nds of computers within the course of a day. It's amazing, and the thing that makes computer worms viruses so awesome is that they are senselessly easy to create with code, but they are always the least wish for any PC user, because they clot up your harddrive and replicate fast, so it's an easy yet extremely effective way to finish someone's computer. More advanced worms can also make it harder for the user to format back his computer, making it even more useless haha :D And the more Im going to learna bout these, I'm going to upload new versions and releases of this worm-ware. And improve it as my skill in python increases. Feel the beeeern.....!!! ;D
